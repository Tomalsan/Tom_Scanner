# Tom_Scanner
Tom_Scanner is a simple  PDF making Cam_scanner clone that uses basics of image processing and image segmentation using a novel DFS-like apporach to find page contour !! 
It is also intriguing as the segemnting system and Canny-Edge is implemented in basic python, no opencv image processing libraries (Other than image read,write and save) is used !! A simple yet good enough project for any image processing and computer vision student to understand contour detection and segmentation handiling !
